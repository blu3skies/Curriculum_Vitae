# Joe Ellingworth
 
I am a full stack developer in training, recently graduated from Makers Academy where I spent the last 16 weeks learning hard and fast about the fascinating world of code.
 
I'm passionate about all things Tech. I spent the last 7 years living and working overseas, in several different countries, including as a scuba dive instructor in Thailand and The Maldives, and as a manager of the watersports department of a high end tourist resort in Malaysia. Looking for something more settled I moved to Mexico where I worked as a Computer Network Technician, and that is where I got bitten by the tech bug. I returned to the UK and spent the last 9 months teaching myself to code before applying to Makers, while earning money troubleshooting others’ tech problems.

 I am a fast learning logical thinker and resourceful team player. I am known as someone who rolls up my sleeves and gets stuck in. I am quietly confident and well rounded. I fall back on the life skills I honed around the world in the variety of settings. Above all I am passionate about coding and problem solving,
 
 ### Fast learning team player
 
 Before I found my passion for coding I worked in several different countries, cultures and settings, always successful in the roles I took on. As evidence of my fast learning, I was promoted to a manager role after having been a scuba diving instructor for a relatively short time. I was hired as the Manager of the Dive and Activity Department at Batu Batu Resort in Malaysia where I successfully managed a team of 6 and a budget of £150,000
 
 I achieved these rapid promotions through being an adaptable team player, a natural team leader, hard working, fast learning, always willing to take on extra responsibilities. Working in remote island resorts with limited external support to call on is testing, and it creates the conditions which forces one to fall back on your own problem solving and I became very resourceful.
 
 ### Hard working, well rounded and passionate about Tech
 
 I was introduced to the tech industry while living in Mexico in 2018. It was a learn-fast-high-pressured rollercoaster but I found that I excelled in it. I learnt a lot in a short time but the two most important things I learnt was I) I love trouble shooting and 2) I'm fascinated about tech.

 ### PADI Master Scuba Diver Trainer
 In the process of becoming a top qualified scuba diving instructor I had to go though the intensive Instructor Development Course (IDC) - beyond the technical knowledge required to work as a scuba instructor, you have to have people skills and take responsibility for the lives of others, you have to be cool under fire and adaptable to new environments such as the underwater world where a dash to the safety of the surface can kill.

 <p>
 
 In 2018 I renovated my dilapidated 1969 Airstream land yacht trailer, a steep learning curve demonstrating resourcefulness, resilience and patience but not much aptitude. (Photos gladly given upon request)
 
 I find joy in recycling scrap materials to make home aquaponics systems (aquaculture - hydroponic combinations), and if i'm not doing that you can find me getting my hands dirty in the ground planting some veggie.
 
 People seek me out to join their projects. I am blessed with a wide and wonderful circle of friends and family, and I love cats but most of all I love my dog Bentley
