<!-- A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what exictes you about tech. -->


I am a full stack developer in training, recently graduated from Makers Academy where I spent the last 16 weeks learning hard and fast about the fascinating world of code.

I'm passionate about all things Tech. I spent the last 7 years living and working overseas, in several different countries, including as a scuba dive instructor in Thailand and The Maldives, and as a manager of the watersports department of a high end tourist resort in Malaysia. Looking for something more settled I moved to Mexico where I worked as a Computer Network Technician, and that is where I got bitten by the tech bug. I returned to UK and spent the last 9 months teaching myself to code before applying to Makers, while earning money troubleshooting others’ tech problems.

  I am a fast learning logical thinker and resourceful team player. I am known as someone who rolls up my sleeves up and gets stuck in. I am quietly confident and well rounded. I fall back on the life skills I honed around the world in the variety of settings. Above all I am passionate about coding and problem solving,

  ### Fast learning team player

  Before I found my passion for coding I worked in several different countries, cultures and settings, always successful in the roles I took on. As evidence of my fast learning, I was promoted to a manager role after having been a scuba diving instructor for a relatively short time. I was hired as the Manager of the Dive and Activity Department at Batu Batu Resort in Malaysia where I successfully managed a team of 6 and a budget of £150,000

  I achieved these rapid promotions through being an adaptable team player, a natural teamleader, hard working, fast learning, always willing to take on extra responsibilities. Working in remote island resorts with limited external support to call on is testing, and it creates the conditions which forces one to fall back on your own problem solving and I became very resourceful.

  #### Hard working, well rounded and passionate about Tech

  I was introduced to the tech industry while living in Mexico in 2018. It was a learn-fast-high-pressured rollercoaster but I found that I excelled in it. I learnt a lot in a short time but the two most important things I learnt was I) I love trouble shooting and 2) I'm fascinated about tech.

  #### Recent months
  
  For the last 6 months I have been working as a general all purpose IT troubleshooter for a number of clients in and around clients.  Notably Ive been managing the social media connection for Emu bikes, and electric bike company based in London. 

  - I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)

  - I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)

  - I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.

  - A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

  <p>

  ## Makers Academy (Dec 2019 to April 2020)

  A 16-week intensive development bootcamp. Starting with the basics of **Object Oriented Principles** we learnt **Ruby**,   Makers from day one encouraged us to use **Test Driven Development** so we became proficient using **RSpec**.  Every Afternoon at Makers we would pair program which played to my strength as a team player and taught me the valuable skill of explaining my code and thinking process to others. 

  We began by building simple web apps and began incorporating databases using **PSQL** at first and later **ORMs**. During the middle section of the course we started to learn **JavaScript** which while was challenging I enjoyed greatly.  As TTD was our way we leant **Jasmine** and even built our own testing framework. 

  The last 5 week of the course were spent working on group projects where we learnt the all important skills of good **Git** workflow, We also worked using the Agile cycle of development. 


  ## Unrelated to tech:

  ### PADI Master Scuba Diver Trainer
  In the process of becoming a top qualified scuba diving instructor I had to go though the intensive Instructor Development Course (IDC) - beyond the technical knowledge required to work as a scuba instructor, you have to have people skills and take responsibility for the lives of others, you have to be cool under fire and adaptable to new environments such as the underwater world where a dash to the safety of the surface can kill.

  ## Hobbies

  In 2018 I renovated my dilapidated 1969 Airstream land yacht trailer, a steep learning curve demonstrating resourcefulness, resilience and patience but not much aptitude. (Photos upon request)

  I recycle scrap into aquaponics gardens, the future of agriculture in dry climates


  (Any cool stuff that makes you a super part of a software development team)


  People seek me out to join their projects. I am blessed with a wide and wonderful circle of friends and family, and I love cats but most of all I love my dog Bentley
