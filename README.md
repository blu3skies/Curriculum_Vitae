# Joe Ellingworth
I graduated from Makers Academy in April 2020 where I spent the 16 weeks learning hard and fast about the fascinating world of code while becoming a full stack developer. I'm passionate about all things tech. 
 
Who am I? Let me tell you my story. Well, university wasnt for me. Instead I needed to get out and grab the world. Starting in marketing in Mumbai, India, I progressed and developed myself while working in many extraordinary places. I eventually became the manager of a department in Batu Batu, the renowned high end tourist resort in Malaysia. On my way there I qualified as a scuba dive instructor and taught in Thailand, The Maldives, Costa Rica and Japan. 

Looking for something more settled I moved to Mexico and that is where I got bitten by the tech bug while working as a Computer Network Technician. I cant believe it took me that long! I returned to the UK last year to entirely refocus my career on software development. Whilst waiting for entry onto the Makers Academy, I taught myself to code while troubleshooting others’ tech problems to earn my living.I confidently tell you my story because it demonstrates I have energy, tenacity, resilience, courage, independence and yet I can adapt easily and work best in teams whilst being a natural leader, or follower, as required.

I am a fast learning logical thinker and resourceful team player. I am known as someone who rolls up my sleeves and gets stuck in. I am quietly confident and well rounded. I fall back on the life skills I honed around the world in a variety of roles and settings. Above all I am passionate about coding and problem solving.

### Fast learning adaptable team player

Before I found my passion for coding I worked in several different countries, cultures and settings, always successful in the roles I took on. As evidence of my fast learning, I was promoted to a manager role after having been a scuba diving instructor for a relatively short time. I was hired as the Manager of the Dive and Activity Department at Batu Batu Resort in Malaysia where I successfully managed a team of 6 and a budget of £150,000.

I achieved these rapid promotions through being an adaptable team player, a natural team leader, hard working, fast learning, always willing to take on extra responsibilities. Working in remote island resorts with limited external support to call on is testing, and it creates the conditions which forces you to fall back on your own problem solving and I became very resourceful.

### Hard working, well rounded and passionate about Tech

I was introduced to the tech industry while living in Mexico. I became a Computer Network Technician for Baja Connect. It was a learn-fast-high-pressured rollercoaster but I found that I excelled in it. I learnt a lot in a short time but the two most important things I learnt was I) I love troubleshooting and 2) I'm fascinated about tech.

I renovated my dilapidated 1969 Airstream land yacht trailer, a steep learning curve demonstrating resourcefulness, resilience and patience but not much aptitude. (Photos proudly supplied upon request)
Recycling scrap materials to make home aquaponics systems (aquaculture - hydroponic combinations), an innovative water and energy efficient method of growing food in  and if i'm not doing that you can find me getting my hands dirty in the ground planting some veggies.
People seek me out to join their projects. I am blessed with a wide and wonderful circle of friends and family, and I love cats but most of all I love my dog Bentley
